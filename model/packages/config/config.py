        ### Constraints:
        - If the input image is not a valid satellite terrain image, return:
        ```json
        {
            "error": "Invalid Input",
            "message": "The provided image is not a valid satellite terrain image."
        }
        ```
        - Do not generate random or unrelated information.
        - Ensure all numerical values are valid floating-point numbers.
        - The response must be in JSON-compatible format, ensuring proper key-value pairing, string formatting, and list structures.

        ### Additional Guidelines:
        - Verify that the input is a satellite terrain image before proceeding with the analysis.
        - The fertility prediction should be derived from visible terrain features such as vegetation density, soil color, water bodies, and land patterns.
        - Bounding boxes must contain precisely 8 coordinates representing four points in the format: `[x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4]`.
        - The "reasons" field should provide factual explanations such as "Sparse vegetation detected," "High soil moisture content," or "Rocky terrain with low organic matter."
        - The "best_crops" list should contain only crops suitable for the identified fertility level.
        - Ensure "probabilities" sum up to approximately 1.0 for accuracy.
        - The "mixed_crop_farming" field must be either "Yes" or "No," based on whether the land can support multiple crop types.

        Your response must be concise, accurate, and directly derived from the input image.
